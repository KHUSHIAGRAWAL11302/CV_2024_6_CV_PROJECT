## ðŸ“Š Evaluate Performance of Indian Road Marking Detection Models

### ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement:
This study focuses on exploring Indian road marking detection models (mainly segmentation-based) and evaluating their performance.

### ðŸš€ Milestones / Deliverables:
- âœ… Explore and list down various publicly available Indian Road marking detection models.
- âœ… Understand the evaluation criteria and dataset (prepare if needed).
- âœ… Understand the working of detection model and if needed perform transfer learning to adapt the model for Indian road marking detection.
- âœ… Create a python based framework to evaluate its performance [Images will be given for testing]
- âœ… Prepare a ground-truth for a given images for benchmarking the performance.
- âœ… Deliver final framework as open-source tool.
